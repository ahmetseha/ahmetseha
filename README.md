ğŸ‘‹ A passionate frontend developer based in Sakarya, Turkey ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡·.

I specialize in crafting modern web experiences using React, Next.js, and React Native. My focus is on building scalable, performant, and user-friendly interfaces.

Beyond frontend, I'm genuinely interested in Rust and Python. I also love diving into maker and DIY projects in my free time.
