ðŸ‘‹ A passionate frontend developer focused on creating robust and intuitive web experiences.

I specialize in crafting modern interfaces using React, Next.js, and React Native. My goal is to build scalable, performant, and user-friendly applications.

Beyond frontend, I have a genuine interest in Rust and Python. In my free time, I love diving into maker and DIY projects, exploring the intersection of technology and hands-on creation.
